# Panes by John Marinelli

This absolute stud John made what I was looking for, well, 80% of it anyways. I needed only a few more functionalities which I added into this version. Unfortunately I am borring from a lot of people for this project, and I dont know how to cite them especially when they dont have a license.

Anyways, see his original here:

Or his reddit post where the creator of charm recognizes him here:
