# Keydra & Aegis

Aegis is gonna be the raw sockets tool. Keydra is gonna be something. Who knows. Cool logos though

Raw Socket was written by https://github.com/oneNutW0nder/CatTails 
I am adding some features and trying to fix some of the problems, but really, all the hard work was done by him

Hopefully will be deployed at IRSeC

See his talk on it here:
